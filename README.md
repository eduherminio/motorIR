Library that allows you to control two DC motors using IR.
It has been designed to easily be able to control any 2 DC motors robot with a simple IR remote control.

It uses [NECIRrcv](https://github.com/eduherminio/NECIRrcv) for IR captation.

Arduino code developed for academic purposes, back in 2016.
